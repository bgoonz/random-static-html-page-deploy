                <p>
                  We may store IP addresses in our server logs to ensure network
                  security, the ability of our system to resist unlawful or
                  malicious actions, such as ‘denial of service’ attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can also store additional technical details about your
                  visits for diagnostic purposes, to fix errors in our service
                  if they occur.
                </p>
                <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH ONLINE TECHNOLOGY</h3>
                <p>
                  Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, local storage,
                  and scripts are used by us and our affiliates, and other
                  companies, such as third party technology service providers
                  and web analytics providers. These technologies make it easier
                  for you to navigate our website and to help us manage the
                  content on our website and are used to analyze trends,
                  administer the sites, track users’ movements around the site
                  (including which site you clicked from to arrive at our site),
                  and gather demographic information about our user base.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
                  transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web
                  browser (if you don’t disable it) that enables the site’s or
                  service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and
                  capture and remember certain information. They are used to
                  help us understand your preferences based on previous or
                  current site activity, which enables us to provide you with
                  improved services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cookies also help us compile aggregate data about site traffic
                  and site interaction so that we can offer better site
                  experiences and tools in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For instance, we use Google Analytics and Yandex Metrika to
                  collect statistics about our site.

                  us confirm your identity and to enable you to exercise the
                  rights set out above. This is a security measure to ensure
                  that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
                  right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
                  further information in relation to your request to speed up
                  our response.
                </p>

                  <li>
                    However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is
                    clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in
                    these circumstances.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    month.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your
                    request is particularly complex or you have made a number of
                    requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you
